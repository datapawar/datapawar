I’m a Data Analyst who makes data show the way to smarter decisions, new possibilities, and a better tomorrow.

## About me
I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s in Forestry, which trained me to think in systems, connect patterns to real-world impact, and stay evidence-driven when information is incomplete.
That mindset is exactly what I bring to analytics: asking the right questions, building reliable reporting, and communicating insights in a way that helps teams decide faster.

## My journey into analytics
I moved into data analytics through curiosity—wanting to understand *why* something is happening, not just *what* is happening.   
Today, I focus on work that goes from messy data → clean model → meaningful visuals → a story that stakeholders can act on.

## UPSC journey (2023-2025)
From 2023 to 2025, I prepared for the UPSC Civil Services Exam and made three attempts. 
That experience strengthened my discipline, structured thinking, and consistency, skills I apply directly in analytics projects and stakeholder-facing reporting. 

## My Toolkit
| Power BI (dashboards, DAX, KPI tracking) | SQL (MySQL) (data extraction, joins, cleaning) | Excel (Power Query, pivots, reporting) |
