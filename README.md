I'm a Data Analyst who makes data show the way to smarter decisions, new possibilities, and a better tomorrow.

## About me
I hold a Bachelor's and Master's in Forestry, which trained me to think in systems, connect patterns to real-world impact, and stay evidence-driven when information is incomplete.
That mindset is exactly what I bring to analytics: asking the right questions, building reliable reporting, and communicating insights in a way that helps teams decide faster.

## My journey into analytics
I moved into data analytics through curiosity wanting to understand *why* something is happening, not just *what* is happening.
Today, I focus on work that goes from messy data → clean model → meaningful visuals → a story that stakeholders can act on.

## UPSC journey (2023-2025)
From 2023 to 2025, I prepared for the UPSC Civil Services Exam and made three attempts.
That experience strengthened my discipline, structured thinking, and consistency, skills I apply directly in analytics projects and stakeholder-facing reporting.

## My Toolkit
| Power BI (dashboards, DAX, KPI tracking) | SQL (MySQL) (data extraction, joins, cleaning) | Excel (Power Query, pivots, reporting) |

# Projects:

<p> In this project I solved a narrative, evidence-driven SQL investigation where every clue lives inside relational tables. Using CTEs, multi-table JOINs, alibi cross-checking, and set intersection logic, I identified the killer by correlating keycard logs, call records, alibi contradictions, and physical evidence across 6 structured investigation steps.

<p> In this project I worked as a Data Analyst for IDC Pizza, analyzing sales data using MySQL to uncover insights, trends, and opportunities. The project is divided into 3 phases + 4 additional insights, each solved with a query and output, covering revenue analysis, order patterns, and pizza performance metrics.

<p> In this project I created an interactive excel dashboard for an ecommerce company using its transactions dataset (Jan–Mar 2025) to track KPIs, trends, customer behavior, delivery performance, geography, and satisfaction. Used PivotTables as the “calculation engine”, calculated helper columns (Days to Deliver, Week Number, cleaned Gender values), PivotCharts + formatting, slicers + report connections, conditional formatting, map charts, and linked pictures for dashboard-friendly visuals.
